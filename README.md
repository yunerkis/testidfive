To compile the styles use:

sass --watch sass:css

by not using any framework, bem is used for classes and styles.

scss was used to speed up the concatenation of the classes.


Things missing about the test:

The Menu is not working, I could used JS vanilla to work but I do not have the time.

The responsive design, could be better, using media queries and flexbox.

The font is not working.

and this is not to excuse, but my pc doesn't work...
